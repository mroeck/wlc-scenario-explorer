## Bugs

If you’ve found a bug, please provide at least a video and at best a minimal reproducible example, this will facilitate the task and speed up the entire process.
Next, submit an issue on the [Issues page](https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/ae/sustainable-construction/dg-grow-eu-scenariotool/scenario-explorer/-/issues).

## Greater changes

If you want to make a greater change, it's a good idea to file an issue first and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed.
We don’t want you to spend a bunch of time on something that we don’t think is a suitable idea.

Once accepted, you can follow the pull request process:

1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your version to your machine.
3. Make sure to track progress upstream by doing `git remote add upstream https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/ae/sustainable-construction/dg-grow-eu-scenariotool/scenario-explorer.git`. 
Before making any changes, make sure to pull changes in from upstream by either doing `git fetch upstream` then merge later, or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step.
4. Make your changes in a new git branch.
5. Write some tests when necessary (no need when fixing a typo).
6. Push changes to your account.
7. Submit a pull request to the develop branch.

Please make sure that your new code and documentation match the existing style.
